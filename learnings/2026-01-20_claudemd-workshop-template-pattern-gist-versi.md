# ## CLAUDE.md Workshop Template Pattern (Gist Version)

## CLAUDE.md Workshop Template Pattern (Gist Version)

**Source**: https://gist.github.com/nazt/3f9188eb0a5114fffa5d8cb4f14fe5a4
**Stars**: 18 | **Forks**: 12

### Structure (Teaching-Friendly)

```
1. Executive Summary
2. Quick Start Guide
3. Project Context (blank template)
4. Critical Safety Rules
5. Development Environment
6. Development Workflows
7. Context Management & Short Codes
8. Technical Reference
9. Development Practices
10. Lessons Learned
11. Troubleshooting
12. Appendices
```

### Core Short Codes (Simplified)

| Code | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ccc` | Create context issue + compact |
| `nnn` | Create implementation plan (NO CODING) |
| `gogogo` | Execute plan step-by-step |
| `lll` | List project status (WORKSHOP EXERCISE) |
| `rrr` | Session retrospective |

### Key Teaching Patterns

1. **Two-Issue Pattern**: ccc (context) → nnn (plan) = separation of concerns
2. **lll as Exercise**: Marked as "WORKSHOP EXERCISE - Attendees create this themselves"
3. **Mandatory Sections**: AI Diary + Honest Feedback marked as REQUIRED
4. **Safety First**: No force flags, no merge without permission
5. **Time Zone Awareness**: GMT+7 primary, UTC in parentheses

### Differences from Full Oracle CLAUDE.md

| Workshop Version | Full Oracle Version |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Generic template | Nat-specific patterns |
| 5 short codes | 15+ commands + skills |
| No Oracle MCP | Full Oracle integration |
| No ψ/ structure | Complete ψ-brain |
| No subagents | Multi-agent (MAW) |

### Good for Teaching Because

1. Self-contained (single file)
2. Fill-in-the-blank sections
3. Workshop exercise built-in
4. Clear safety rules
5. Progressive complexity
